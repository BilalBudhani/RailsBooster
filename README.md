# üöÄ RailsBooster
Preconfigured Ruby On Rails Boilerplate To Provide Instant Productivity ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Motivation behind the project
I regularly keep experimenting with ideas and problems to solve with Ruby On Rails as my choice of stack. However, I find myself configuring Rails as per my preference with every new project to reach to a stage where I can start working on the actual business logic.

RailsBooster is an attempt to put together all the common configurations, gems and best practices in one place which will eliminate the need of all prerequisites and immediately enables working on the actual business logic.
